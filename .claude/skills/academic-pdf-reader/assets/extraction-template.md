## Example: Quick Extract (Marriott Case)

```markdown
# Marriott Corporation: El Coste del Capital

**Case:** HBS 202-S08 | **Date:** April 1988 | **Topic:** Divisional Cost of Capital

## Core Question
Calculate appropriate hurdle rates for Marriott's three divisions (Hotels, Contract Services, Restaurants)

## Key Data Points
- **Corporate Beta:** 1.11
- **Corporate D/V:** 41%
- **Tax Rate:** 34%
- **Risk-free rate (30yr):** 8.95%
- **Market risk premium:** 7.43% (1926-1987 average)

## Target Capital Structures (from case)
| Division | D/V | Credit Spread |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Hotels | 74% | 1.10% |
| Contract Services | 40% | 1.40% |
| Restaurants | 42% | 1.80% |

## Analysis Steps
1. Unlever comparable company betas (Anexo 3)
2. Calculate divisional unlevered betas
3. Relever at target capital structures
4. Apply CAPM for cost of equity
5. Calculate cost of debt (rf + spread)
6. Compute WACC for each division

## Expected Result
Three distinct hurdle rates reflecting different business and financial risks of each division
